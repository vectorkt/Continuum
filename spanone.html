            <h2 class="text-left">If you could span time at will… what kind of civilization would you be entering?</h2>
            <br>

            <p class="text-left">If you had a time machine, one that could go into the past and future, couldn’t you just go and find the best one ever made? So except, perhaps, for the prototype, the best time machine would be the one in use.</p>
            <p class="text-left">What would the best machine be? Following the human logic of instant gratification, the best would one allow travel at will. In fact, it would just be standard equipment. No external device to get broken, stolen or lost. You'd learn how yourself. You would <b><i>be the machine</i></b>.</p>
            <p class="text-left">And if one person learned how, they would be everywhere, up and down spacetime. This newborn time traveler would find already in place civilizations he never suspected before.</p>
            <p class="text-left">So now take a realist' approach: How do humans organize themselves?</p>
            <p class="text-left">Most time travel stories or arguments have to invent a time police, government or similar motivator to create the reason for a hero or ream of heroes to go out and top a villain or save a victim. While a police authority may wish to exercise control over time, the time travelers already living there have more than enough means to keep their skill hidden from the ignorant, and handle crises amongst themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">The laws of time travel become laws of behavior.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">From this guiding principle does the universe unfold.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Spanning</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Travelling in time is called <span id="span">Spanning</span>, and one who is capable of it is called a <span id="spanner">Spanner</span>. Time travel is somewhat of a misnomer, as the earth spirals through space, following the sun revolving around the galactic center. Time travel 500 years into the past without traveling in space as well, and one finds himself in interstellar void. Not good. Hence, functional
                <span id="span">Spanning</span> is actually spacetime travel, as one needs to teleport over vast distances of space as well.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><span id="spanner">Spanners</span> vanish and appear silently when they travel. Occasionally a small noise may be heard from displaced air. No external devices or vehicles are required for <span id="spanner">Spanners</span> to travel. It feels very right, and has no unpleasant side effects, unless you've pushed yourself beyond your limits.</p>
            <p id="text-left">When <span id="span">Spanning</span>, velocity, momentum, and acceleration take the properties of the surrounding environment upon arrival. Thrown out blindfolded and handcuffed out of an aircraft, and heading towards the ground at terminal velocity? <span id="span">Span</span>. Now only a pair of handcuffs and a blindfold are racing towards the ground, while you arrive safely at your favorite bar at happy hour and have a cold one.</p>



            <p id="text-left">As a <span id="spanner">Spanner</span>, you have an expendable amount of <span id="#span">Span</span>, used whenever <span id="span">Spanning</span> through spacetime. Each 1 day of Span is worth 3 meters travelled Level. So if you begin with 1 year of <span id="span">Span</span> and Span Down 50 days, you have 315 days of Span left. If you then <span id="span">Span</span> 60 meters, you have 295 days of <span id="span">Span</span></p>
            <p id="text-left">You must rest for 24 hours, 8 of which must be uninterrupted sleep, to recover all your <span id="span">Span</span>.
                <span id="span">Spanning</span> when you have expended this allocation is dangerous, and can result in injury or death. Being heavily stressed prevents you from resting.</p>
            <p id="text-left"><span id="span">Span</span> also functions as somewhat of a social class among <span id="spanner">Spanners</span>. You begin in a category known as <span id="span">Span One</span>. At this <span id="span">Span</span> you can travel roughly 1 year and or roughly 1 km, while carrying 5 kilograms, not including small and close personal items such as clothes or whatever is in your pockets. You also add your <span id="span">Span</span> category as a bonus (at <span id="span">Span One</span> it’s a +1) to rolls regarding <span id="span">Spanning</span>.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">History as a Ladder</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">The terms past, and future are largely discarded, being useful only to <span id="leveller">Levellers</span>. When a <span id="spanner">Spanner</span> spans toward the Big Bang he is said to be spanning <span id="down">Down</span>. When he travels away from the Big Bang he is spanning <span id="up">Up</span>. Spanning levelly, of course is spanning <span id="level">Level</span>.</p>


            <p id="text-left">Despite being disjoint from history itself, a <span id="spanner">Spanner</span> still ages, and therefore has a personal history. Your personal, required past is called <span id="age">Age</span>. This is everything that you remember happening to you, such as attending school, your first love etc. However, as a <span id="spanner">Spanner</span> you might find out information about future self such as finding a picture of yourself in a century old newspaper, meeting an older version of yourself etc. This personal required future is called <span id="yet">Yet</span>.</p>


            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Gemini</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="image">Encountering oneself is almost inevitable, and is calld a <span id="gemeni">Gemeni Incident</span>. Each incident, naturally, happens twice: once for the <span id="junior">Junior</span> (the "junior incident") and once again later for the <span id="elder">Elder</span> (the "elder incident"). Curiosity drives <span id="junior">Junior</span> spanners, and responsibility and necessity leads <span id="elder">Elders</span> back to <span id="gemeni">Gemini incidents</span>.</div>​
            <p class="text-left">During the <span id="junior">Junior</span> incident, GM portrays the <span id="elder">Elder</span> spanner. During the <span id="elder">Elder</span> incident, the GM reprises the <span id="junior">Junior</span> spanner. This allows the player to experience the <span id="gemeni">Gemini</span> much as his character would.</p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Frag</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">How time travel works depends on the grandfather paradox. What happens if you go in the past to kill your grandfather? A paradox appears: having killed you grandfather, you do not exist, therefore couldn’t have killed your grandfather, therefore you do exist and can kill your grandfather etc. </p>
            <p class="text-left">In practice, this murder is called an <span id="asnot">As/As not</span>. Everyone affected by the death of your grandfather is being slowly wiped from existence by fragmentation (<span id="frag">Frag</span> for short). </p>
            <p class="text-left"><span id="frag">Frag</span> is bad. If the <span id="asnot">As/As not</span> is severe enough and remains unresolved it will slowly destroy the universe. The universe does not heal all paradox nor are alternate timelines created. Therefore, to insure the survival of the universe, <span id="sentientforce">Sentient Force</span> must be applied to fix the <span id="asnot">As/As not</span>. Simply put, <i>causality has to make sense.</i></p>
            <p class="text-left">This is why <span id="age">Age</span> and <span id="yet">Yet</span> are know as required past and required future, respectively. Once you know something happens, it is your responsibility that it happens.</p>
            <p class="text-left">An example: If you kill Hitler, you <span id="frag">Frag</span> other <span id="spanner">Spanners</span>, meaning other affected time travelers who do not wish to be wiped out of existence will step in to fix the problem by replacing Hitler. Thus, the universe is preserved. </p>
            <p class="text-left">Unfortunately, you’ve just pissed off a lot of <span id="spanner">Spanners</span> who will make sure this does not happen again, usually by killing and/or <span id="frag">Fragging</span> you and only you out of existence.This is the ultimate fate of all <span id="narcissist">Narcissists</span>.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Therefore, the rules of time travel become rules of behavior, and <span id="spanner">Spanners</span> form a culture and community based on these rules. This culture is known as the <span id="continuum">Continuum</span>, and the rules of time travel behavior are known as <span id="maxims">Maxims</span>. Among other things, the <span id="continuum">Continuum's</span> objective is preparing humanity for the time when <span id="span">Spanning</span> becomes universally available. This is known as <b><i>Inheritor Space</i></b>, as humanity is fundamentally changed by the introduction of time travel to all its members.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Span Book</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Each <span id="spanner">Spanner</span> keeps a <b><i>Span Book</b></i>, where he technically records every Span in time ever made to help avoid paradox. In practice and gameplay however, this is very slow and difficult. After all, we are role-playing <span id="spanner">Spanners</span>, not actually Spanning. As such, the only requirement is to write up a general trace of where you’ve been Spanning in your <b><i>Span Book</b></i> at the end of each session. </p>
            <p class="text-left">A <b><i>Span Book</b></i> is also used to record other important things, such as events in the Yet, Gemini incidents, As/As Nots etc. These are easy enough to record, and must be recorded on the spot.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Not keeping a <b><i>Span Book</b></i> can result in Frag at the GM’s discretion.</p>

            <h2 class="text-left">An illustrated example of all of the above</h2>

            <h2 class="text-left">Nota bene</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Don’t worry if you can’t wrap your head around the concept at the beginning. Figuring out how to think in four dimensions is part of the fun. This is what we’ll be spending the first few sessions doing. While you can probably find more literature on Continuum out there, I don’t recommend it. First, it might confuse you. Second, it might give you spoilers. </p>
            <p class="text-left">Also, an important note is that this isn’t going to be a hard historical campaign. Some consistency will be kept, but some realism will have to be sacrificed, as even the most erudite historian couldn’t handle everything that the game is going to cover.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-left">The sixties are a time of great change in the USA. In a strong economy, the middle class begins sending more and more of its young to universities. This leads to social reform, including minority rights and a rising counterculture. It’s also a time of strife. The Cold War is in full swing, the world nearly engulfed in nuclear fire with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Troops are deployed in Vietnam. Kennedy is assassinated. The Space Race is on. Humanity lands on the moon.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In the quiet background of it you all belong to the Blue Dojo corner led by Frank Stein, in Chinatown, L.A.</p>

            <h2 class="text-left">An extra bit of Character flair</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Your <b><i>Character</i></b> can be anyone that grew up in a Los Angeles middle class neighborhood. You’ll also need a date of birth with a Zodiac sign. Try to aim for a 20 or 30 something. Also, three significant or traumatic life events, dated by calendar, are required.</p>
            <p class="text-left"></p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Character, Stats, and Core Mechanic</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Each <b><i>Character</b></i> is initially defined by three Skills: <b><i>Background</b></i>, <b><i>Profession</b></i>, and <b><i>Hobby</b></i>. These must be specific, i.e. if a <b><i>Character</b></i> has a soldier Profession he must decide if he’s a rifleman, paratrooper, special ops etc. After choosing these, the player must assign <b><i>Ranks</b></i> to each <b><i>Skill</b></i> (standard set is +3, +2, +1 in any order preferred). <b><i>Ranks</b></i> specify exactly how good a Character is on those associated <b><i>Skills</b></i>. In essence if you can justify how a <b><i>Skill</b></i> is relevant for the situation, you can add it to your roll.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Rolling is simple. You roll a ten sided die, add bonuses and penalties, then compare it to a targer number. If it's equal or higher, the character succeeds at his action.</p>
            <p class="text-center"><b><i>1d10 + Skill Rank + Modifiers VS Target Number<br>If equal or higher, the roll is successful.</b></i>
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Criticals</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">When rolling a 1 or a 10, the die is rerolled, and the new result is kept. On a double 10, a <b><i>Character</b></i> has performed a <b><i>Critical Success</b></i> (i.e. producing not only a painting, but the next Mona Lisa). On a double 1, a <b><i>Character</b></i> has a <b><i>Critical Failure</b></i> (the gun not only misses, but hits an ally).</p>
